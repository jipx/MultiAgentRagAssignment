    {
      "question": "What is the primary purpose of using Morgan in this lab?",
      "choices": ["To encrypt log files", "For logging in Express.js applications", "To manage database connections", "To handle user authentication"],
      "answer": "For logging in Express.js applications",
      "explanation": "Morgan is used in this lab to apply secure logging practices in an Express.js application, allowing for customizable log formats and outputs."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which module is used to create rotating log files?",
      "choices": ["fs", "path", "morgan", "rotating-file-stream"],
      "answer": "rotating-file-stream",
      "explanation": "The rotating-file-stream module is used to create a rotating log stream, which helps manage log size by creating new log files periodically."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the default logging format used when first applying Morgan?",
      "choices": ["dev", "combined", "common", "tiny"],
      "answer": "combined",
      "explanation": "The lab instructions show that Morgan is initially applied using the 'combined' format, which provides Apache-style log output."
    },
    {
      "question": "How often are log files rotated in this lab setup?",
      "choices": ["Every 6 hours", "Every 12 hours", "Every 24 hours", "Every week"],
      "answer": "Every 12 hours",
      "explanation": "The lab sets up a rotating log stream with a 12-hour interval using the configuration option 'interval: '12h''."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the purpose of creating a custom token for exception logging?",
      "choices": ["To encrypt error messages", "To include custom error information in logs", "To prevent exceptions from occurring", "To send error notifications"],
      "answer": "To include custom error information in logs",
      "explanation": "The custom token for exception logging allows including specific error messages in the log entries, enhancing the detail of error reporting."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following is NOT included in the custom JSON log format?",
      "choices": ["Method", "URL", "IP address", "User agent"],
      "answer": "User agent",
      "explanation": "The custom JSON format includes method, URL, IP, date, and exception, but does not include the user agent information."
    },
    {
      "question": "How is an exception simulated in the lab?",
      "choices": ["By creating a syntax error", "By setting wrong database credentials", "By overloading the server", "By deleting essential files"],
      "answer": "By setting wrong database credentials",
      "explanation": "The lab instructs to edit the database configuration file and intentionally set wrong credentials to simulate an error condition."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the correct order of applying middleware in Express for this lab?",
      "choices": ["Body parser, routes, Morgan", "Morgan, body parser, routes", "Routes, Morgan, body parser", "Morgan, routes, body parser"],
      "answer": "Morgan, body parser, routes",
      "explanation": "The troubleshooting tips mention that Morgan should be applied after the body parser and before the routes for proper logging."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which module is used to ensure cross-platform compatibility when managing log directories?",
      "choices": ["fs", "path", "os", "process"],
      "answer": "path",
      "explanation": "The path module is used in conjunction with fs to manage cross-platform log directories, ensuring compatibility across different operating systems."
    },
    {
      "question": "What security consideration is mentioned regarding logs?",
      "choices": ["Logs should always be encrypted", "Exposing logs may leak sensitive information", "Logs should be deleted immediately", "Only admins should have access to logs"],
      "answer": "Exposing logs may leak sensitive information",
      "explanation": "The lab mentions in the Learning Points section that understanding the security implications of exposing logs is important, as it may leak sensitive information."
