# 🧪 Auto-Split & Ingest Lab Assistant using Amazon Bedrock

## 🎯 Project Goal

Enable educators to upload a full lab PDF and automatically:

- 🔍 Extract each step (e.g., "Step 1", "Step 2")
- 🏷️ Attach metadata (`lab_id`, `step_number`)
- ☁️ Upload and ingest to Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Base (KB)
- 🧑‍🎓 Allow students to:
  - View lab steps
  - Ask questions per step
  - Receive AI-generated hints and step-by-step answers

## 🧩 Components

### 1. Lambda Function (Triggered by S3)
- Extracts text using `pdfplumber`
- Splits content into steps using regex
- Uploads `.txt` per step to S3
- Ingests each step to Bedrock KB with metadata

### 2. Amazon Bedrock
- Claude 3 Sonnet for generation
- Titan Embeddings + Knowledge Base
- Filters per `lab_id` and `step_number`

### 3. Streamlit UI
- Tabbed interface:
  - 📘 View Lab
  - 🧠 Ask Assistant
  - 💡 Generate Hint
- Uses Bedrock API for RAG answers

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **AWS Lambda** – automation logic
- **Amazon S3** – storage for raw and split files
- **Amazon Bedrock** – Claude 3 + Titan Embeddings
- **Streamlit** – student frontend
- **pdfplumber** – PDF parsing

---

## ✅ Workflow

1. Educator uploads `labs/lab3/lab3_lab.pdf`
2. Lambda:
   - Extracts "Step 1" to "Step N"
   - Uploads as `labs/lab3/step1.txt`, etc.
   - Ingests each with metadata into Bedrock KB
3. Student:
   - Selects lab and step in Streamlit
   - Asks question
   - Gets hint and answer from Claude 3 via Bedrock RAG

## 🧠 Claude 3 Prompt Template (Lab Assistant)

```jinja
You are an intelligent lab teaching assistant designed to help students understand technical lab steps.

## Lab Information:
- Lab ID: {{ lab_id }}
- Step Number: {{ step_number }}
- Title: {{ lab_title }}

## Context from the Lab Step:
{{ retrieved_context }}

---

## Student Input:
{{ user_question }}

---

## Instructions:
1. Use only the above lab context and the student's question to generate your response.
2. If the question is unclear or incomplete, ask a clarifying question.
3. If the answer is not in the retrieved context, say:
   - "The provided lab instructions do not explicitly cover this."
   - Offer a general suggestion based on typical best practices.
4. If the user asked for a **hint**, provide a gentle nudge without giving away the full solution.

---

## Output Format:
### ✅ Hint (if applicable):
{{ hint }}

### ✅ Answer:
{{ full_answer }}
```
